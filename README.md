# Patient-Control-and-Monitor
This is the Architecture design docuement of Patient Control and Monitoring System.

The Patient Monitoring and Control System is a standalone system in Hospital Management. It is used for monitoring the health of the patient and controlling the location of patients. With this system, doctors and nurses working in the hospital are able to monitor the information of the patients in each department.

The system provides up-to-date patients' health status and their location so that the doctors and nurses can track their patients immediately. The system also provides relocation functionality so that the doctors and nurses can move the patient to another bed or room. The system is accessible from the employee's mobile device using the provided account.

In the architectural document, you can find stakeholders requirements, decomposition viewpoint, usage viewpoint and C&C viewpoint. 
We also provide several Quality Attribute scenarios for the system, please refer to Quality Attribute Scenario document.
